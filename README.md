### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a software development team with experience creating game applications on the android playform. The request is to create a design document and begin development on a web based version of their Draw It or Lose It muiltiplayer game.

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I did a great job in analysing the benefits and drawbacks of each operating platform in terms of development, server, and client applications with The Gaming Room's mission and requirements in mind.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document helped me to consider all of the aspects and structures that would be needed to run the application before any code was written. Having the documentation to plan the application requirements ahead of time streamlined the process for writing the code.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could improve upon a section of the document it would be the recommendation section. In a real scenario, it would be great to speak with the clients to view a demo of the Android version of the Draw It or Lose It app to get a better idea of the requirements to make the recommendations section more specific to their needs.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs primarily from the perspective of enjoing the game experience while playing the Draw It or Lose It applicaiton in addition to any concerns a user might have. For example, a good gaming experience would mean a low latency and minimal interruption experience during the game, and the ability to securily access their user and team data without losing it to an unauthorized user.

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach to software design is to list out all of the requirements and constraints for the application. From there, I can draft UML diagrams to plan out the architecture of the program while referencing standard design patterns for any code systems that are involved. I plan to continue using this process so that my application has all of the features mapped out before any code is written to minimize development time and the number of revisions needed.
